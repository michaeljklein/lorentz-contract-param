# This contract's behavior heavily depends on environment in which it's executed.
# 1. It fails if its balance is greater than 1000.
# 2. It fails if NOW is less than 100500.
# 3. It fails if the address passed to it is a contract with parameter `address`.
# 4. It fails if the amount transferred to it is less than 15.
# 5. Its final storage value is whether remaining gas (almost) in the end is greater than 1000.
