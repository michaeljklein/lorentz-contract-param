# Indigo eDSL

Indigo eDSL is a high level language over Lorentz. 
The main feature of the language is that it supports variables 
and that you are freed of a burden of manual stack management.
You can construct expression using variables and constants within them
and they will be compiled in Lorentz.

Also the language supports all typical imperative statements like If, While, For, etc.
Variables are destroyed when you leave a scope, like in any other imperative languages.
